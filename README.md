## About

\ove\ist is an app that lets you create and track fun date activities and organize them into different collections based on any kind of context - i.e. dates you want to do with your significant other vs outings you want to experience with your friends, dates you want to have in one city vs another, etc. You can create these collections and share them with your loved ones as well so they can help track it as well. 

I made this app because I noticed I would always be thinking up fun ideas I wanted to do with people, but when it actually came time to plan an activity with someone I would end up drawing a blank. So I decided a create a place where I could save them :)

Sometimes I even noticed that I would be in the mood for a specific type of activity over an other, i.e. maybe I would want something that didn’t break the bank, so I added filters and tags to this date tracker so you can find exactly the perfect date to go on next!

I hope this helps you as much as this helped me :)


## The App

This app was created using NextJS with Supabase as the database. I used this side project to practice a couple different things: user and session management, handling state and higher order components, next js’s new app router, and setting up and using my own database.
